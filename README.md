# Overview
Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform, enables project funding by collecting small contributions from a large audience online. Using Power BI and Tableau, data analysis provides insights into project outcomes, location distribution, and category trends. The analysis evaluates monetary success through Amount Raised, Number of Backers, and Average Days to Completion. It identifies top-performing projects based on backers and funding while assessing overall and category-specific success rates. Temporal trends by year, quarter, and month help uncover growth patterns and opportunities for improvement.

# Objectives
- Provide a platform to visualize project outcomes, analyze location distribution, categorize by project type, and assess temporal dimensions by year, quarter, and month for comprehensive insights.
- Gauge monetary success through Amount Raised, assess Number of Backers, and evaluate project efficiency by calculating Average Days to Completion.
- Identify impactful projects by emphasizing those with the highest Number of Backers and pinpoint the top performers based on the highest Amount Raised.
- Determine the overall success rate, identify category-specific strengths and opportunities, assess temporal trends, and gain nuanced insights by evaluating success rates within customized goal ranges.

# Business Findings and solutions

## 1. Kickstarter Crowdfuning Data Overview 

**Objective:** Analyze project distribution, funding success, and backer engagement to assess crowdfunding effectiveness.

**Visualization:** Built KPI's for Projected created, Total locations overview, Total creators, Total backers, Total categories, Successful projects, Total amount pledged.

**Insights:** Kickstarter demonstrates strong global reach and project diversity, but a significant funding gap and limited backer engagement highlight opportunities for growth.

## 2. Find the total number of projects based on outcomes

**Objectives:** Analyze project success and failure rates to identify key trends and improvement areas.

**Visualization:**  Built a pie chart displaying the percentage each state of projects

**Insights:** With 52% of projects failing and only 39% succeeding, enhancing funding strategies and backer engagement is crucial for improving success rates.

## 3. Find the total Number of Projects based on Locations

**Objectives:**  Identify the regions contributing to project volume and analyze geographic trends.

**Visualization:** Built a bar chart showing top 5 locations with more project volumns

**Insights:** California, New York, England, Texas, and Florida lead in project creation, indicating strong entrepreneurial and crowdfunding activity in these regions.

## 4. Find the total Number of Projects created by date

**Objectives:** Analyze temporal trends in project creation to identify growth patterns and key milestones.

**Visualization:** Built a line chart representing trends of project creation.

**Insights:** Project creation steadily increased, peaking in 2014 (59,155 projects), with Q4 2014 and December 2014 being the busiest periods, while 2009 had the lowest activity.

## 5. Calculate the amount pledged for each project category.

**Objective:** Assess funding distribution to understand which project categories attract the most pledges.

**Visualization:** Built a column chart showing amount pledged based on project states.

**Insights:** Successful projects dominate pledges ($3.48B), while failed ($0.25B) and canceled ($0.8B) projects highlight inefficiencies in funding allocation.

## 6. Find the backers count for each project category. 

**Objective:** Analyze backer engagement across successful, failed, and other project categories.

**Visualization:** Built a column chart showing backers count based on project states.

**Insights:** Failed projects attracted the most backers (188.2K), indicating strong interest but potential funding or execution issues.

## 7.  Successful Projects Data Overview 

**Objective:** Evaluate the scale, engagement, and efficiency of successful projects.

**Visualization:** Built KPI's for Total successful projects, total backers count for sucessful projects, total pledged amount, average days for successful projects

**Insights:** 140,313 projects succeeded, raising $3.479B from 4,239 backers, with an average completion time of 80.38 days.


## 8. Find the successful projects in each category.

**Objective:** Identify the most and least successful project categories to understand trends and opportunities.

**Visualization:** Built a bar chart showing sucessful projects in each category.

**Insights:** Product Design (17.86%) leads in success, followed by Tabletop Games (12.52%) and Music (12.18%), while Art has the lowest success rate (6.36%).


# 9. Find the total number of Sucessful Projects created by date.

**Objective:** Analyze trends in project success rates to identify peak periods and potential declines.

**Visualization:** Built a line chart representing trends of successful projects.

**Insight:** Success rates peaked in 2014 (16.17%) and remained strong through 2017, but saw a notable decline in 2018 (10%) and a sharp drop in early 2019 (0.4%).

## 10. Find out top successful projects based on backers count.

**Objective:** Analyze the most successful projects based on backer count to identify trends in supporter engagement.

**Visualization:** Created table showing top successful projects based on backers count.

**Insight:** The top 5 "successful" projects have backer counts (4-5), suggesting success is defined by funding goals rather than broad supporter engagement.

## 11.  Find out top successful projects based on amount pledged.

**Objective:** Identify the top 5 most successful projects based on the highest amount pledged to understand key funding trends.

**Visualization:** Created table showing top successful projects based on amount pledged.

**Insight:** Tech and gaming projects dominate the highest pledged amounts, with "Pebble Time" leading at $20.3M, highlighting strong backer interest in innovative consumer products.
